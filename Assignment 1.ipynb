      "2  Scrooge knew he was dead?\n",
      "3  Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years.\n",
      "4 Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend and sole mourner.\n",
      "5 And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\n",
      "6  Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\n",
      "7 There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley.\n",
      "8  The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley.\n",
      "9 Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names: it was all the same to him.\n",
      "10 But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge!\n",
      "11  External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge.\n",
      "12 They often \"came down\" handsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n",
      "13  Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\n",
      "14 when will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.\n",
      "15 Even the blindmen's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, \"no eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\" But what did Scrooge care?\n",
      "16 To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\n",
      "17  Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.\n",
      "18  The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters.\n",
      "19 Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal.\n",
      "20  But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part.\n",
      "21 It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach.\n",
      "22  \"Bah!\" said Scrooge, \"Humbug!\" He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n",
      "23  \"Christmas a humbug, uncle!\" said Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "24 \"You don't mean that, I am sure.\" \"I do,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "25 You're rich enough.\" Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, \"Bah!\" again; and followed it up with \"Humbug.\" \"Don't be cross, uncle,\" said the nephew.\n",
      "26 If I could work my will,\" said Scrooge, indignantly, \"every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas,' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.\n",
      "27  \"Nephew!\" returned the uncle, sternly, \"keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.\" \"Keep it!\" repeated Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "28 \"But you don't keep it.\" \"Let me leave it alone, then,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "29  \"Let me hear another sound from _you_\" said Scrooge, \"and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation.\n",
      "30 Dine with us to-morrow.\" Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he did.\n",
      "31  \"But why?\" cried Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "32 \"Why?\" \"Why did you get married?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "33  \"Because I fell in love.\" \"Because you fell in love!\" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas.\n",
      "34 Why give it as a reason for not coming now?\" \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "35  \"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?\" \"Good afternoon,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "36 So A Merry Christmas, uncle!\" \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "37  \"And A Happy New Year!\" \"Good afternoon!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "38 He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially.\n",
      "39  \"There's another fellow,\" muttered Scrooge; who overheard him: \"my clerk, with fifteen shillings a-week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry Christmas.\n",
      "40 I'll retire to Bedlam.\" This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had let two other people in.\n",
      "41 They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office.\n",
      "42  \"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,\" said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list.\n",
      "43 \"Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?\" \"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\" Scrooge replied.\n",
      "44 At the ominous word \"liberality,\" Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.\n",
      "45  \"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\" said the gentleman, taking up a pen, \"it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.\n",
      "46 Many thousands are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\" \"Are there no prisons?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "47  \"And the Union workhouses?\" demanded Scrooge.\n",
      "48 Still,\" returned the gentleman, \"I wish I could say they were not.\" \"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "49 I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "50 What shall I put you down for?\" \"Nothing!\" Scrooge replied.\n",
      "51  \"You wish to be anonymous?\" \"I wish to be left alone,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "52 I help to support the establishments I have mentioned: they cost enough: and those who are badly off must go there.\" \"Many can't go there; and many would rather die.\" \"If they would rather die,\" said Scrooge, \"they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\n",
      "53  \"It's not my business,\" Scrooge returned.\n",
      "54 Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n",
      "55 The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at Scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.\n",
      "56 The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of-- \"God bless you merry gentleman!\n",
      "57  May nothing you dismay!\" Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action, that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial frost.\n",
      "58 With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out, and put on his hat.\n",
      "59  \"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "60  \"If quite convenient, Sir.\" \"It's not convenient,\" said Scrooge, \"and it's not fair.\n",
      "61  \"And yet,\" said Scrooge, \"you don't think _me_ ill-used, when I pay a day's wages for no work.\" The clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n",
      "62  \"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!\" said Scrooge, buttoning his great-coat to the chin.\n",
      "63 Be here all the earlier next morning!\" The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\n",
      "64  Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the news-papers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's-book, went home to bed.\n",
      "65 It was old enough now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.\n",
      "66 The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.\n",
      "67 It is also a fact, that Scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a bold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery.\n",
      "68 Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley, since his last mention of his seven-years' dead partner that afternoon.\n",
      "69 And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate process of change: not a knocker, but Marley's face.\n",
      "70 It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly spectacles turned up upon its ghostly forehead.\n",
      "71  As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n",
      "72 Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes.\n",
      "73 There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom.\n",
      "74  Half a dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.\n",
      "75  Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that: darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it.\n",
      "76 Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob.\n",
      "77  \"Humbug!\" said Scrooge; and walked across the room.\n",
      "78 Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains.\n",
      "79  \"It's humbug still!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "80 It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cashboxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.\n",
      "81 His body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.\n",
      "82  Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now.\n",
      "83  \"How now!\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.\n",
      "84  \"Who are you?\" \"Ask me who I _was_.\" \"Who _were_ you then?\" said Scrooge, raising his voice.\n",
      "85  \"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley.\" \"Can you--can you sit down?\" asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him.\n",
      "86  \"I can.\" \"Do it then.\" Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so _London · Chapman & Hall, 186 Strand._ transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation.\n",
      "87  \"I don't,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "88  \"What evidence would you have of my reality, beyond that of your senses?\" \"I don't know,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "89  \"Why do you doubt your senses?\" \"Because,\" said Scrooge, \"a little thing affects them.\n",
      "90 There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!\" Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means waggish then.\n",
      "91  To sit, staring at those fixed, glazed eyes, in silence for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him.\n",
      "92 Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.\n",
      "93  \"You see this toothpick?\" said Scrooge, returning quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned; and wishing, though it were only for a second, to divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.\n",
      "94  \"You are not looking at it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "95  \"But I see it,\" said the Ghost, \"notwithstanding.\" \"Well!\" returned Scrooge.\n",
      "96 Humbug, I tell you--humbug!\" At this, the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself from falling in a swoon.\n",
      "97  Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n",
      "98 \"Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?\" \"Man of the worldly mind!\" replied the Ghost, \"do you believe in me or not?\" \"I do,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "99  \"You are fettered,\" said Scrooge, trembling.\n",
      "100 Is its pattern strange to _you_?\" Scrooge trembled more and more.\n",
      "101 It is a ponderous chain!\" Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see nothing.\n",
      "102 \"It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men.\n",
      "103 My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!\" It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.\n",
      "104  \"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,\" Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n",
      "105  \"Seven years dead,\" mused Scrooge.\n",
      "106 Incessant torture of remorse.\" \"You travel fast?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "107  \"You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "108 such was I!\" \"But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,\" faultered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself.\n",
      "109 Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted _me_!\" Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n",
      "110 \"My time is nearly gone.\" \"I will,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "111 Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow.\n",
      "112 A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.\" \"You were always a good friend to me,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "113 \"Thank'ee!\" \"You will be haunted,\" resumed the Ghost, \"by Three Spirits.\" Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done.\n",
      "114  \"It is.\" \"I--I think I'd rather not,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "115 Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls one.\" \"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?\" hinted Scrooge.\n",
      "116 Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its teeth made, when the jaws were brought together by the bandage.\n",
      "117 It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.\n",
      "118 Scrooge stopped.\n",
      "119  Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity.\n",
      "120 Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives.\n",
      "121  Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered.\n",
      "122  When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber.\n",
      "123  \"Why, it isn't possible,\" said Scrooge, \"that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night.\n",
      "124 This was a great relief, because \"three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,\" and so forth, would have become a mere United States' security if there were no days to count by.\n",
      "125  Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.\n",
      "126  Every time he resolved within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again like a strong spring released, to its first position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, \"Was it a dream or not?\" Scrooge lay in this state until the chimes had gone three quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.\n",
      "127  \"Ding, dong!\" \"A quarter past,\" said Scrooge, counting.\n",
      "128  \"Ding, dong!\" \"Half past!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "129  \"Ding, dong!\" \"A quarter to it,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "130  \"Ding, dong!\" \"The hour itself,\" said Scrooge, triumphantly, \"and nothing else!\" He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.\n",
      "131 The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.\n",
      "132  Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was _not_ its strangest quality.\n",
      "133  \"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "134  \"Who, and what are you?\" Scrooge demanded.\n",
      "135  \"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.\" \"Long past?\" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish stature.\n",
      "136  \"No. Your past.\" Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.\n",
      "137 Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow!\" Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend, or any knowledge of having wilfully \"bonneted\" the Spirit at any period of his life.\n",
      "138  Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end.\n",
      "139 and walk with me!\" It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time.\n",
      "140  \"I am a mortal,\" Scrooge remonstrated, \"and liable to fall.\" \"Bear but a touch of my hand _there_,\" said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, \"and you shall be upheld in more than this!\" As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand.\n",
      "141  \"Good Heaven!\" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together, as he looked about him.\n",
      "142 \"And what is that upon your cheek?\" Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.\n",
      "143  \"Remember it!\" cried Scrooge with fervour--\"I could walk it blindfold.\" \"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!\" observed the Ghost.\n",
      "144  \"Let us go on.\" They walked along the road; Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.\n",
      "145  \"They have no consciousness of us.\" The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one.\n",
      "146 What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?\n",
      "147 \"A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.\" Scrooge said he knew it.\n",
      "148  They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house.\n",
      "149 At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be.\n",
      "150  Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panneling, not a drip from the half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n",
      "151  \"Why, it's Ali Baba!\" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstacy.\n",
      "152 And Valentine,\" said Scrooge, \"and his wild brother, Orson; there they go!\n",
      "153 What business had _he_ to be married to the Princess!\" To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city, indeed.\n",
      "154  \"There's the Parrot!\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "155  \"I wish,\" Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff: \"but it's too late now.\" \"What is the matter?\" asked the Spirit.\n",
      "156  \"Nothing,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "157 I should like to have given him something: that's all.\" The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand: saying as it did so, \"Let us see another Christmas!\" Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty.\n",
      "158 The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you do.\n",
      "159 Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.\n",
      "160  A terrible voice in the hall cried, \"Bring down Master Scrooge's box, there!\" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him.\n",
      "161 Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove gaily down the garden-sweep; the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray.\n",
      "162 \"But she had a large heart!\" \"So she had,\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "163 God forbid!\" \"She died a woman,\" said the Ghost, \"and had, as I think, children.\" \"One child,\" Scrooge returned.\n",
      "164 \"Your nephew!\" Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly, \"Yes.\" Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were.\n",
      "165  The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\n",
      "166  \"Know it!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "167 At sight of an old gentleman in a Welch wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement: \"Why, it's old Fezziwig!\n",
      "168 Dick!\" Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.\n",
      "169  \"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!\" said Scrooge to the Ghost.\n",
      "170  During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits.\n",
      "171  \"A small matter,\" said the Ghost, \"to make these silly folks so full of gratitude.\" \"Small!\" echoed Scrooge.\n",
      "172 Is that so much that he deserves this praise?\" \"It isn't that,\" said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.\n",
      "173  \"Nothing particular,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "174  \"No,\" said Scrooge, \"No. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now!\n",
      "175 That's all.\" His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air.\n",
      "176 \"Quick!\" This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect.\n",
      "177 For again Scrooge saw himself.\n",
      "178  \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, \"show me no more!\n",
      "179  \"No more!\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "180 Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like the last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw _her_, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter.\n",
      "181 The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty.\n",
      "182  And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father, and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.\n",
      "183 \"Mr. Scrooge.\" \"Mr. Scrooge it was.\n",
      "184 Quite alone in the world, I do believe.\" \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge in a broken voice, \"remove me from this place.\" \"I told you these were shadows of the things that have been,\" said the Ghost.\n",
      "185 \"That they are what they are, do not blame me!\" \"Remove me!\" Scrooge exclaimed.\n",
      "186 Haunt me no longer!\" In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head.\n",
      "187  The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.\n",
      "188  [Illustration: Scrooge's third Visitor.\n",
      "189  Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One.\n",
      "190 Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.\n",
      "191  The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter.\n",
      "192 The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney, as that dull petrifaction of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone.\n",
      "193 In easy state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge, as he came peeping round the door.\n",
      "194 and know me better, man!\" Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this Spirit.\n",
      "195 He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though its eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them.\n",
      "196 \"Look upon me!\" Scrooge reverently did so.\n",
      "197  \"Never,\" Scrooge made answer to it.\n",
      "198  \"I don't think I have,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "199  \"A tremendous family to provide for!\" muttered Scrooge.\n",
      "200  \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge submissively, \"conduct me where you will.\n",
      "201 To-night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.\" \"Touch my robe!\" Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\n",
      "202 The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch.\n",
      "203  \"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "204 My own.\" \"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "205 To a poor one most.\" \"Why to a poor one most?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "206  \"Because it needs it most.\" \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, \"I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment.\" \"I!\" cried the Spirit.\n",
      "207  \"You would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "208  \"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "209 It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "210  Remember that, and charge their doings on themselves, not us.\" Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town.\n",
      "211 It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's) that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.\n",
      "212  And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch.\n",
      "213  \"Spirit,\" said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt before, \"tell me if Tiny Tim will live.\" \"I see a vacant seat,\" replied the Ghost, \"in the poor chimney corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved.\n",
      "214 If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.\" \"No, no,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "215 If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.\" Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.\n",
      "216 to hear the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!\" Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast his eyes upon the ground.\n",
      "217  \"Mr. Scrooge!\" said Bob; \"I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!\" \"The Founder of the Feast indeed!\" cried Mrs.\n",
      "218 I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it.\" \"My dear,\" said Bob, \"the children; Christmas Day.\" \"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,\" said she, \"on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard, unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge.\n",
      "219 Scrooge was the Ogre of the family.\n",
      "220  After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with.\n",
      "221 But they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.\n",
      "222  By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms, was wonderful.\n",
      "223  \"What place is this?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "224  The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and passing on above the moor, sped whither?\n",
      "225 To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it rolled, and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.\n",
      "226  Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship.\n",
      "227  It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh.\n",
      "228 It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's, and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n",
      "229  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "230 \"Ha, ha, ha!\" If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too.\n",
      "231 When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he.\n",
      "232 Ha, ha, ha, ha!\" \"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!\" cried Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "233 \"He believed it too!\" \"More shame for him, Fred!\" said Scrooge's niece, indignantly.\n",
      "234  \"He's a comical old fellow,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that's the truth; and not so pleasant as he might be.\n",
      "235 However, his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.\" \"I am sure he is very rich, Fred,\" hinted Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "236 \"At least you always tell _me_ so.\" \"What of that, my dear!\" said Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "237 He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going to benefit us with it.\" \"I have no patience with him,\" observed Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "238 Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion.\n",
      "239  \"Oh, I have!\" said Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "240 He don't lose much of a dinner.\" \"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner,\" interrupted Scrooge's niece.\n",
      "241 I am very glad to hear it,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"because I haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers.\n",
      "242 What do _you_ say, Topper?\" Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.\n",
      "243 Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.\n",
      "244  \"Do go on, Fred,\" said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.\n",
      "245 He is such a ridiculous fellow!\" Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was unanimously followed.\n",
      "246  \"I was only going to say,\" said Scrooge's nephew, \"that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.\n",
      "247 He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\n",
      "248 If it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, _that's_ something; and I think I shook him, yesterday.\" It was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge.\n",
      "249 Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing: you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of Christmas Past.\n",
      "250 My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it.\n",
      "251  Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party, but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her.\n",
      "252 Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you.\n",
      "253 There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for, wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often guessed right, too; for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge: blunt as he took it in his head to be.\n",
      "254  \"Here's a new game,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "255 \"One half hour, Spirit, only one!\" It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what; he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was.\n",
      "256 Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to \"Is it a bear?\" ought to have been \"Yes;\" inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way.\n",
      "257 Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say 'Uncle Scrooge!'\" \"Well!\n",
      "258 Uncle Scrooge!\" they cried.\n",
      "259  \"A Merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!\" said Scrooge's nephew.\n",
      "260 Uncle Scrooge!\" Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time.\n",
      "261 In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.\n",
      "262  It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together.\n",
      "263 It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly older.\n",
      "264 Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was gray.\n",
      "265  \"Are spirits' lives so short?\" asked Scrooge.\n",
      "266 \"It ends to-night.\" \"To-night!\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "267  \"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,\" said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, \"but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts.\n",
      "268  Scrooge started back, appalled.\n",
      "269 are they yours?\" Scrooge could say no more.\n",
      "270 And bide the end!\" \"Have they no refuge or resource?\" cried Scrooge.\n",
      "271  Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.\n",
      "272 When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n",
      "273  \"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "274  \"You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,\" Scrooge pursued.\n",
      "275  Although well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it.\n",
      "276  But Scrooge was all the worse for this.\n",
      "277  \"Lead on!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "278 Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.\n",
      "279 But there they were, in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\n",
      "280 Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk.\n",
      "281  Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation.\n",
      "282 Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here.\n",
      "283  Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.\n",
      "284  They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute.\n",
      "285  Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop.\n",
      "286 He can't look uglier than he did in that one.\" Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror.\n",
      "287 Ha, ha, ha!\" \"Spirit!\" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot.\n",
      "288  The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was.\n",
      "289  Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom.\n",
      "290 The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face.\n",
      "291  No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed.\n",
      "292 What _they_ wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.\n",
      "293  \"I understand you,\" Scrooge returned, \"and I would do it, if I could.\n",
      "294  \"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion caused by this man's death,\" said Scrooge quite agonized, \"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!\" The phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were.\n",
      "295  \"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death,\" said Scrooge; \"or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just now, will be for ever present to me.\" The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen.\n",
      "296  \"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them.'\" Where had Scrooge heard these words?\n",
      "297 Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little--\"just a little down you know\" said Bob, enquired what had happened to distress him.\n",
      "298  \"Spectre,\" said Scrooge, \"something informs me that our parting moment is at hand.\n",
      "299 Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.\n",
      "300  \"This court,\" said Scrooge, \"through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time.\n",
      "301  \"The house is yonder,\" Scrooge exclaimed.\n",
      "302  Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in.\n",
      "303  \"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,\" said Scrooge, \"answer me one question.\n",
      "304  \"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "305  Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.\n",
      "306  \"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!\" Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed.\n",
      "307  \"They are not torn down,\" cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, \"they are not torn down, rings and all.\n",
      "308  \"I don't know what to do!\" cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings.\n",
      "309  \"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!\" cried Scrooge, starting off again, and frisking round the fire-place.\n",
      "310  \"I don't know what day of the month it is!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "311  \"What's to-day?\" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\n",
      "312  \"What's to-day, my fine fellow?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "313 \"Why, CHRISTMAS DAY.\" \"It's Christmas Day!\" said Scrooge to himself.\n",
      "314  \"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the corner?\" Scrooge inquired.\n",
      "315  \"An intelligent boy!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "316  \"What a delightful boy!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "317  \"Is it?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "318  \"No, no,\" said Scrooge, \"I am in earnest.\n",
      "319  \"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!\" whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh.\n",
      "320  \"I shall love it, as long as I live!\" cried Scrooge, patting it with his hand.\n",
      "321  \"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "322 The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present; and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile.\n",
      "323 A merry Christmas to you!\" And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.\n",
      "324  He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his counting-house the day before and said, \"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?\" It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.\n",
      "325  \"My dear sir,\" said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands.\n",
      "326 A merry Christmas to you, sir!\" \"Mr. Scrooge?\" \"Yes,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "327 And will you have the goodness\"--here Scrooge whispered in his ear.\n",
      "328 \"My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?\" \"If you please,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "329 \"I don't know what to say to such munifi--\" \"Don't say anything, please,\" retorted Scrooge.\n",
      "330  \"Thank'ee,\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "331 But he made a dash, and did it: \"Is your master at home, my dear?\" said Scrooge to the girl.\n",
      "332  \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where is he, my love?\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "333 He knows me,\" said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock.\n",
      "334  \"Fred!\" said Scrooge.\n",
      "335 Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done it, on any account.\n",
      "336 Your uncle Scrooge.\n",
      "337 Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.\n",
      "338  \"Hallo!\" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it.\n",
      "339 \"I _am_ behind my time.\" \"You are?\" repeated Scrooge.\n",
      "340 I was making rather merry yesterday, sir.\" \"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge, \"I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer.\n",
      "341 He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it; holding him; and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\n",
      "342  \"A merry Christmas, Bob!\" said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back.\n",
      "343 Make up the fires, and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!\" * * * * * Scrooge was better than his word.\n"
